<h3>PUBLICLY VISIBLE INFORMATION</h3>
If you create a user profile on Creator or the Social Media Marketing Society or leave a comment on Creator, certain information may be publicly visible.

<h3>COOKIES</h3>
Creator uses cookies to: store visitors’ preferences; record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit; ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads; or customize our content based on visitors’ browser type or other information that the visitor sends. We also share information about your use of our Website with our social media, advertising, and analytics partners. This section explains what cookies are, how we use Cookies and similar technologies on our Website, and what you can do to manage how Cookies are used.

<h3>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h3>
A cookie is a small text file that is sent to your computer or mobile device (referred to in this policy as a “device”) by the web server so that a website can remember some information about your browsing activity on the Website. The Cookie will collect information relating to your use of the Website, information about your device such as the device’s IP address and browser type, demographic data, and if you arrived at our Website via a link from a third-party site, the URL of the linking page.
In addition to Cookies, the Website may use web beacons. Web beacons allow us to count the number of users who have visited or accessed the Website and to recognize users by accessing our cookies. We may employ web beacons to facilitate Website administration and navigation, track the actions of users of the Website, compile aggregate statistics about Website usage and response rates, and provide an enhanced online experience for visitors to the Website. We may also include web beacons in HTML-formatted email messages that we send to determine which email messages were opened. A web beacon is often invisible because it is only 1 x 1 pixel in size with no color. A web beacon can also be known as a web bug, 1 by 1 GIF, invisible GIF, and tracker GIF.

<h3>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COOKIES AND HOW DO WE USE THEM?</h3>
Essential: These are Cookies that are essential for the running of our Website. Without these Cookies, parts of our Website would not function. These Cookies do not track where you have been on the internet and do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing purposes.
Examples of how we may use essential Cookies include:
Setting unique identifiers for each unique visitor, so that website numbers can be analyzed.
Functional: These Cookies are used to remember your preferences on our Website and to provide enhanced, more personal features. The information collected by these Cookies is usually anonymized, so we cannot identify you personally. Functional Cookies do not track your internet usage or gather information that could be used for selling advertising.
Examples of how we may use functional Cookies include:
Gathering data about visits to our Website, including numbers of visitors and visits, length of time spent on the site, pages clicked on or where visitors have come from.
Eliminating the need for returning users to re-enter their login details.
Analytical Performance: Analytical performance Cookies are used to monitor the performance of our Sites, for example, to determine the number of page views and the number of unique users our Website has. We use this information to improve the user experience or identify areas of the Website which may require maintenance. The information is anonymous (i.e. it cannot be used to identify you and does not contain personal information such as your name and email address) and it is only used for statistical purposes.
Examples of how we may use analytical Cookies include:
Measuring users’ behavior
Analyze which pages are viewed, for how long, and which links are followed to better develop our Website.
Advertising: Behavioral advertising Cookies, which may be placed on your device by us or our trusted third-party service providers, remember that you have visited a website and use that information to provide you with advertising which is tailored to your interests. This is often called online behavioral advertising and is done by grouping together shared interests based on web browsing history. Your web browsing history can be used to infer things about you (e.g. your age, gender, etc.), and this information may also be used to make advertising on websites more relevant to you. Although behavioral advertising Cookies can track your activity around the internet, these Cookies cannot identify you personally, even if you are signed in to our Website.
Examples of how we may use advertising Cookies include:
Manage online advertising. Our approved advertising partners use Cookies together with web beacons to provide advertising to you and to enable us to manage our relationship with those advertisers by, for example, tracking how many unique users have seen a particular advertisement or followed a link in an advertisement.
To market to specific users across our Website and third-party sites, so that we and third parties can target advertising to users that will be more relevant to users’ interests.
Third-Party Cookies: You may notice on some pages of our Website that Cookies have been set that are not related to us. When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Facebook, these third-party service providers may set their own Cookies on your device. We do not control the use of these third-party Cookies and cannot access them due to the way that Cookies work, as Cookies can only be accessed by the party who originally set them. Please check the third-party websites for more information about these Cookies.

<h3>HOW CAN YOU MANAGE OR OPT OUT OF COOKIES?</h3>
Cookies, including those which have already been set, can be deleted from your hard drive. You can also change the preferences/settings in your web browser to control Cookies.
